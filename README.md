# IntelliBusLogger

## Overview
IntelliBusLogger - Bus Management System is an advanced web application engineered to optimize the tracking and logging of college buses. This system incorporates RFID technology, bringing precision and efficiency to transportation management in an academic setting.

## Key Features
1. **RFID Technology:** We strategically install RFID Readers at college gates, and each bus is equipped with an RFID tag. The readers scan these tags to track buses as they enter and exit the premises.

2. **Accurate Tracking:** The RFID technology provides accurate records of bus movements, ensuring reliable tracking and logging for transportation management.

3. **Data-Driven Management:** This system is not just about trackingâ€”it's about data-driven decision-making. The data collected provides valuable insights for college administrators to optimize bus scheduling and ensure timely arrivals and departures.

## Objective
Our innovative solution aims to enhance the efficiency of transportation management. With accurate data at their fingertips, college administrators can ensure an effective, reliable, and punctual bus service for students and staff.
